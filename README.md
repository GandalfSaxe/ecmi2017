# ecmi2017

[ECMI Modelling Week 2017](http://www.mafy.lut.fi/ECMIMW2017/) was a mathematics modeling week in Lappeenranta, Finland on July 9th - July 16th 2017. There were 9 teams, one for each of the [problems](http://www.mafy.lut.fi/ECMIMW2017/index.php?page=problems).

Project Lambda was about optimization of snow plowing operations in Skinnarila area near Lappeenranta. We wanted to minimize the distance travelled by the snow plowing vehicles, and if possible, prioritize roads differently.

# Introduction
The problem turned out to be a variation of the [Chinese Postman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_inspection_problem) (CPP) (a.k.a route inspection problem) on a graph having road intersections as nodes and intersection distances as edges. With this basic model, the problem basically had three parts:

1. **Data acquisition**
2. **Solution**
3. **Visualizing solution**

And in summary we found:

1. **Data acquisition:** We opted for the Google Maps API to create our graph, despite the free API-key limitations, since it was very easy to work with. We ended up making a graph of the limited area of priority 1 roads, in a very manual fashion.
2. **Solution**: We basically worked on two solutions: 1. Optimal solution of basic CPP problem using by finding optimal pairings of odd-degree vertices (aided by [Blossom algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blossom_algorithm)) in order to restructure the graph into an Eulerian graph, for which the CPP can then solved in polynomial time, and 2. A stochastic algorithm (a.k.a. "penalty scout") with a cost function that penalize undesirable moves such as traveling the same edge multiple times, making needless U-turns etc.
3. **Visualizing solution**: We used the [Google Maps Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/) to obtain coordinates for routes between read intersections and [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) to animate a symbol on the maps (luckily Google had provided a some [nice sample code](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/overlay-symbol-animate)). This could be done after the solution was converted from a list of nodes to a list of (latitude, longitude) coordinates, using the Google Maps Directions API

# 1. Problem and results
The total length of all the edges in our (one-way) graph is 24.2355 km.
However, since it's not Eulerian, this distance is not achievable and the snowplow would have to travel a longer distance. We found the theoretical lower bound of a solution to be 30.5275 km, which is exactly what both algorithms found.

# 2. How to use code
Due to the time constraints, the following is a series of not-so-pretty, but functional workflows of obtaining road graph data, obtaining route solutions and visualizing them using Google Maps API.

## Obtain graph of road network
Coming soon...

## Obtain solutions for efficient routes

### Find optimal route using Penalty scout algorithm
All code you need for finding a solution with our Penalty Scout Algorithm is within the `Penalty_Scout_Algorithm.py` file.
1. Create graph with the `manual_map_one` function, which is calling a distance matrix from a CSV file. (If needed, add attributes such as visits within the function loop)
2. Within the `valuevertex` function you can change which characteristics increase the value (our penalty).
3. Within the `nextpoint` function, the `borders` variable is representing probabilities for each element. Change several entries, if lower or higher probabilities are wanted.
4. Choose how many iterations you want to try and call the `start_penalty_scout` function. It will return the best candidate of all N attempts and the iteration number. And it will save a CSV-file containing all improvements and paths.
5. Best path found will be last entry in the saved `penaltyscoutloglength.csv` file.

## Convert list of nodes into list of coordinates
1. Open `map-plotting/google_maps_plotting2.Rmd` (using RStudio).
2. Install R googleway package if you haven't: `install.packages(googleway)`.
3. Start by inserting two API keys: 1. Copy your [Google Maps Directions API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/) into the variable `key` (used to find coordinates of roads between intersections) and the [Maps JavaScript API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) into the variable `map_key` (used to draw coordinates on a map).
4. Insert the route solution as a list of nodes in the variable `routeNodes`. For example: `routeNodes <- c(0,1,2,3,4,3,5,3,6)`.
5. Run the whole script in `google_maps_plotting2.Rmd`. The whole route has now been written into file `route.csv` as a (latitude, longitude) coordinate list, in the same directory.
6. Run `route-conversion.py`. It's a very simple 16-line python script that converts the (lat,lon) list in `route.csv` into a list format in file `route-lat-lon.txt`, which is needed in the final script.

## Visualize solutions using Google Maps API
1. Open file `map-plotting/animation/polyline-animation_googledev.html`. At the bottom of the script, insert your Maps JavaScript API key into the string variable `src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=INSERT-MAPS-JS-API-KEY-HERE&callback=initMap">`. 
2.  Paste the contents of into the file `route-lat-lon.txt` into variable `var lineCoordinates`.
2. Open `polyline-animation_googledev.html` in a browser. Enjoy :)

As a final step, we then screen recorded the animation, trimmed, cropped, recompressed it and added a red trail (see next section)

## Add red motion lines to the route animation
1. Run script `map-plotting/animation/animation-videos/red-motion-lines.py` on video file.

Special thanks to my friend [jakejhansen](https://github.com/jakejhansen) for this script.

*Warning: may require a somewhat cumbersome installation of `OpenCV` in python.*
