Overview:

This folder contains a .mat file with the manually constructed distance matrix, a vector of geographical coordinates, an adjacency matrix, and a graph corresponding to the matrix, and a vector indicating the degree of each node.
Also, there is a .m MATLAB file for constructing and plotting the matrices.

Objects:
::M - distance matrix. Size 24-by-24.
::Deg - vector of degrees. Size 24-by-1.
::Inc - indicence matrix.
::G - graph corresponding to M.
::Coords - matrix of coordinates in format [longitudes, latitudes], size 24-by-2.
