============MOST PROMISING============
---------Chinese Postman Problem.pdf---------
explains the classical algorithm to solve the most simple form of the problem.
Can (relatively) easily be implemented by us from the ground up.
    -> 1 vehicle, one-way streets, no priorities, etc.

---------Synchronized_arc_routing_for_snow_plowing_operatio.pdf---------
Two pieces pseudocode that *might* be able to be implemented and tested.
Relatively recent paper that deals with two-way streets.


============NEEDS ASSESSMENT============

---------Computing optimal snowplow route plans using Genetic Algorithms.pdf---------

---------Snow-Plow Route Planning using AI Search.pdf---------






============TOO LONG============
---------review_part_i_perrier2006.pdf---------
---------review_part_ii_perrier2006.pdf---------
---------review_part_iii_perrier2007.pdf---------
Too detailed. summarize work done on optimizing snow plowing-related problems. Some of them tackle the hardest forms of the problem:
    -> More than one vehicle, priorities, refueling, etc.

---------adaptive_large_neighborhood_search.pdf---------
Too long. long review of this heuristic method that seems to be used a lot in snow-plowing optimization problems

---------Smith2_TSETFinalReport.pdf---------
A collection of papers. tackles the hardest forms of the problem:
    -> More than one vehicle, priorities, refueling, dynamical update, etc.

---------Randby2015 Optimizing routes for snow plowing in Trondheim using evolutionary algorithms.pdf---------
Too long. 2015 study from Norway, using Memetic algorithm.
There seems to be some pre-precessing steps etc., and the whole thing would take too much time

---------SSP_Chapter-8.pdf---------
A little old, and more importantly, no pseudocode.
